Stratos Improvement Proposal

## SIP Types

There are three kinds of SIP:

- A **Standards** Track SIP describes any change that affects most or all Stratos implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Stratos.
  Furthermore, Standards Track EIPs can be broken down into the following categories:
    - **Core**: improvements requiring core consensus upgrade, including change the consensus of chain validator, traffic considerations, proof-of-traffic consensus etc.
    - **Networking**: includes improvements around p2p communication between nodes and the relay mechanism between different Stratos Networks.
    - **Interface**: includes improvements around language-level standards like method names and rpc names.
    - **SRC**: application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, storage light-node extension etc.

- An **Informational** SIP describes a Stratos design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Stratos community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SIPs do not necessarily represent a Stratos community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational SIPs or follow their advice.

- A **Process** SIP describes a process surrounding Stratos, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SIPs are like Standards Track SIPs but apply to areas other than the Stratos protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Stratos' codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational SIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Stratos development. Any meta-SIP is also considered a Process SIP.
